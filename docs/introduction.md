Hello! Welcome to the Wasmer Documentation!

[Wasmer](https://wasmer.io/) is an open-source runtime for executing WebAssembly on the Server. Our mission is make all software universally available. We support running Wasm modules standalone in our runtime, but also can be embedded in multiple languages using our language integrations. We also have many other project such as: [WAPM (WebAssembly Package Manager)](https://wapm.io/), [Wasmer-js](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-js), [WebAssembly.sh](https://webassembly.sh/), and many more!

For an overview of WebAssembly, and what WebAssembly is, [take a look here](https://webassembly.org/).
