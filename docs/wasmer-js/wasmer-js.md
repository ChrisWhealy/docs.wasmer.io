IO Devices is an experimental feature of Wasmer and Wasmer-JS. This feature allows WASI modules to read/write to special files in the Wasmer Filesystem, which then allow for functionality such as: handling user input, displaying grapics, etc... 

To learn more about how IO Devices works, take a look at the explainer. Or how to build Wasm Modules that interface with the IO Devices feature, take a look at the io-devices-lib documentation.
