WAPM (WebAssembly Package Manager) is a package manager for host webassembly modules to be used standalone by a WebAssembly Runtime (such as the Wasmer Runtime), or bundled into your projects.

The wapm ecosystem makes WebAssembly more accessible to developers. The system is enabled by a couple tools:

- wapm package registry for storing and serving packages
- wapm package client (called *wapm-cli*) for installing and managing packages

The tool comes bundled with [wasmer: the WebAssembly runtime](https://wasmer.io/), but it works great with the other [server-side runtimes](https://github.com/mbasso/awesome-wasm#non-web-embeddings) and the web!

The name wapm is an abbreviation for WebAssembly Package Manager, but then name represents the ecosystem of packages and the tools.

To get started with WAPM, we suggest starting with getting wapm installed, and following the getting started guide.
